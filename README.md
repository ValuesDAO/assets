# Rainbow Wallet Assets


## Overview
Rainbow Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Rainbow Wallet](https://rainbow.me) uses token logos from this source

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.


## Adding an ERC20 token checklist:
- [ ] Make sure your smartcontract has more than 2,500 address holders, otherwise you will be rejected
- [ ] Fork the Github repository
- [ ] Create folder with name of token smartcontact address in lowercase format.
- [ ] Tell your designer that token image must be in PNG format, avoid transparent background, recommended size 256x256px, max. 512x512px, with max file size of 100kB. Please us [Image Optim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) or similar on larger files.
- [ ] Upload your logo with file named `logo.png` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x1234567461d3f8db7496581774bd869c83d51c93/logo.png`
- [ ] Create `info.json` file with info about the token/project
- [ ] Create a pull request to the main repo

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `make check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `make fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `make update-auto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)
- `make add-token asset_id=c60_t0x1234567461d3f8db7496581774bd869c83d51c93` -- Create `info.json` file as asset template.
- `make add-tokenlist asset_id=c60_t0x1234567461d3f8db7496581774bd869c83d51c93` -- Adds a token to tokenlist.json.
- `make add-tokenlist-extended asset_id=c60_t0x1234567461d3f8db7496581774bd869c83d51c93` -- Adds a token to tokenlist-extended.json.

## On Checks

This repo contains a set of scripts for verification of all the information. Implemented as Golang scripts, available through `make check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.
There are similar check logic implemented:

- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR.  Checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app shows result in PR comment. Executes in a non-browser environment.
